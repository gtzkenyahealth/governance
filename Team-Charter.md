# Vue.js Team Guidelines

## Introduction

As an open-source project, Vue.js supports the community by giving them confidence that the team will consistently maintain, drive, and guide the project. These guidelines outline the expectations of Vue.js team members for current members and those who would like to be on the team.

## Background

_This section was inspired by the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-examples-of-formal-roles-used-in-open-source-projects)._

There are three roles that people often take on when it comes to contributing to open source:

- **Maintainer** - People who feel responsible for the direction of the project and is committed to improving it
- **Contributor** - People who add value to the project (i.e., triaging issues, pull requests, updating documentation, etc.)
- **Committer** - People who have commit and/or release permissions

Vue.js team members take on these roles to varying degrees based on the individual. In addition, there is one additional trait that is critical to being a team member: _**consistency**_.

## What is the Vue.js Team?

The Vue.js Team consists of members in the community who have provided valuable contributions to the community and are recognized for their efforts and time. While contribution differs between individuals, each person contributes to the ecosystem in their own individual way.

### What is expected of a team member?

#### Maintain a consistent presence in the project

There are no quotas that we use to measure people's contribution. In order to be a team member, team members are expected to contribute consistently, so that the community and team can depend on them.

Examples of contributions include:

- Building features
- Fixing bugs
- Maintaining codebases
- Maintaining documentation
- Responding to issues
- Reviewing pull requests
- Managing the release process
- Responding in our forum
- Contributing to the project direction
- Speaking at events as a representative of their project(s)

People are usually invited to join the team because they have made significant contributions within the Vue.js ecosystem, and in part, because we would like to keep in touch and coordinate in higher throughput means rather than PRs or issues. Examples of this type of communication can include, but are not limited to: Discord chat, meetings, calls, off-sites, and conferences.

#### Serve as a representative of the team

While each team member is entitled to a level of privacy they are comfortable with, it is critical that all team members understand that **their** **words and conduct are not only a reflection of themselves, but also a reflection on the team**.

In other words, team members must understand and accept the responsibility that they are held to a higher standard than normal contributors. This means that in addition to adhering to the [Code of Conduct](https://v3.vuejs.org/coc/), team members must understand that any personal opinions expressed in public forums (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, etc.) are taken as a representative of the team’s values.

However, team members are not expected to manage conflicts or communication issues on their own. If they need assistance with crafting responses to sensitive or difficult situations, the team is here to support you.

### Privileges

- Access to Vue.js Team Discord
- Membership in the GitHub vuejs organization
- Access to organization private repos
- Ability to participate in bi-weekly team meetings
- Entry on the team page on vuejs.org
- Ability to use the title "Vue.js team member" in public

### Nomination and Approval

- A team member can be nominated by any current team member
- The nomination can be approved by at least two core team members OR by the team lead.

## What is the Vue.js Core Team?

A core team member must demonstrate long term interest in and commitment to the improvement of the Vue.js ecosystem. This is often proven through an established history of significant contributions and/or becoming an integral part of the community.

In addition to the responsibilities and expectations of a Vue.js team member, what follows is a general framework for what the team values when selecting people for the core team.

What is expected of a core team member?

#### Maintain a consistent presence in the project

In general, core team members are expected to maintain a consistent presence in the project. Some of these responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

- Contributing to the project at least once a month
- Participating in meetings (via async communication / live attendance)
- Being reachable by other core team members within a reasonable amount of time

We also look for contributions over a longer period of time, so that we know the community can depend on the members long term.

#### Serve as a representative of the team and community

Similar to Vue.js team members, while each core team member is entitled to a level of privacy they are comfortable with, it is critical that all core team members understand that **their** **words and conduct are not only a reflection of themselves, but also a reflection on the team and the community**.

In addition, core team members must understand and accept the responsibility that they are held to the highest standard amongst the team. This means that in addition to adhering to the [Code of Conduct](https://v3.vuejs.org/coc/), core team members must understand that any personal opinions expressed in public forums (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, etc.) are taken as a representation of the team and community’s values.

However, just like standard team members, this does not mean that core team members are expected to manage conflicts or communication issues on their own. If they need assistance with crafting responses to sensitive or difficult situations, the team is here to support you.

#### Be a reliable team player

In addition, there are two additional traits that are critical to being a core team member: **consistency** and **collaboration**. Joining the core team is a commitment to not only the public but your team as well.

While the amount of time that each core team member can dedicate varies (which contributes to their consistency), it's also important to remember that our team is one that requires collaboration and teamwork.

### Privileges

On top of standard team member privileges:

- Entry on the core team page on vuejs.org
- Ability to use the title "Vue.js core team member" in public

### Nomination and Approval

- A core team member can be nominated by an existing core team member or the project lead.
- Only current active team members can receive core team member nominations.
- The nomination can only be approved by the project lead, after consulting the general consensus of the current core team members.

## What if I am unable to meet these expectations?

While a consistent presence is expected of team members, sometimes a team member needs to step away from the project temporarily or wants to move away from the project entirely. In these cases, some options team members have include:

### 1. Taking some time off

The benefit of being on a team is that you are not solely responsible for the entire project. Members are welcome to take time off of the project. We will remove you from the team page during your absence so that it’s clear who is still available on the team. You can still be a contributor during this time.

### 2. Switching to an emeritus role

The emeritus role is a status that allows team members to transition from their position on the team while still being recognized for their past contributions.

There are two ways that team members can be switched into emeritus status:

1. A team member voluntarily opts-in
2. A consensus is reached by the core team and/or project lead to move a team member to move them into emeritus status if they are inactive for an extended period of time

This is not a permanent status. They can transition back into an active team role if they are able to take on those responsibilities again and have the approval of the team.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
